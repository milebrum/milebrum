### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on broadening my set of skills!
ðŸŒ± learning React and Java
âœ¨ most excited about growing as wide as I can, as fast as I can, as deep as I can
:heartpulse: being patient with my process and grateful for every opportunity.  
  
:exclamation: How to reach me: milenabrum.f@gmail.com
